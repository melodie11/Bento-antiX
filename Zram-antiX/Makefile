#  To install, type `make install` from within the root directory of the bundle,
#  with the administration rights.
#  To remove, type `make uninstall` also using administration rights.

# Main targets
all:
	@# Type 'make install' to install ZRAM control scripts and configuration.
	@# Type 'make uninstall' to remove them.

## Installation target
install:
# Installation of ZRAM components complete.
# Copying files and setting permissions...

# The default zram configuration file goes into /etc/default
	install -m 644 $(SRC_DEFAULT_CONF) $(DEST_DEFAULT_DIR)

# The zram init script goes into /etc/init.d
	install -m 755 $(SRC_INIT_SCRIPT) $(DEST_INIT_DIR)

# The toggle-zram-gui.sh GUI script goes into /usr/local/bin
	install -m 755 $(SRC_GUI_SCRIPT) $(DEST_GUI_DIR)

# The zram-control.desktop desktop file goes into /usr/share/applications
	install -m 644 $(SRC_DESKTOP_FILE) $(DEST_DESKTOP_DIR)

# Starting ZRAM service...
# Ensure the post-install script is executable before running it
	chmod +x $(SRC_POST_INSTALL)
# Execute the post-install script, passing DESTDIR as an argument for packaging awareness
# This script is responsible for managing update-rc.d or similar system configurations.
	./$(SRC_POST_INSTALL) $(DESTDIR)

# Uninstallation target
uninstall:
# Ensure the post-removal script is executable before running it
	chmod +x $(SRC_POST_REMOVAL)
# Execute the post-removal script, passing DESTDIR as an argument for packaging awareness
	./$(SRC_POST_REMOVAL) $(DESTDIR)

# Removing installed files...
	rm -f $(DEST_DEFAULT_FILE)
	rm -f $(DEST_INIT_FILE)
	rm -f $(DEST_GUI_FILE)
	rm -f $(DEST_DESKTOP_FILE)
