The files "menu.xml", "rc.xml" and "autostart" from "/etc/skel/.config/openbox" 
provide a set of right-click menus on the desktop and on your panel(s) (it works
with tint2, if the tint2rc configuration file has the right option setup for it,
and not with lxpanel as it has it's own right-clic menu).

The `oblocale.sh` script located in the scripts sub-directory allows you to
switch the openbox menu from English to French or to German. Feel free to
submit one or more translations for the *lang* directory!  

The file menu.xml contains a line to start the program openbox-menu in
persistant mode, for dynamic and fast regeneration of the applications menus,
and an entry to use the obsession program to manage the shutdown/reboot etc.

The file autostart allows starting programs while initiating the X session 
(the Graphical mode).

It is configured to start several ones and you can customize it, with the help
of the comments.

Some applications can make use of *.desktop files placed in the the
`$HOME/.config/autostart` directory.

Some do not play well with xdg-autostart, (desktop files in the autostart
directory),  ie: the volumeicon program's desktop file, while some do.
It's up to you to test if you want to. Usually, they work fine as it is.

The rc.xml brings in some customized keyboard shortcuts for your Bento Openbox
branded distribution, and you can add more shortcuts or tweak them later.

If you install this set of configuration files and you do have Openbox
configuration files of your own you might want to backup your
`$HOME/.config/openbox`  original files before using this setup, incase you want
to revert or merge your configurations later.

The *scripts/xcompmgr.sh* and *scripts/xsnow.sh* files referred to in the
autostart-* and menu.xml-* files are installed in `/usr/local/bin`.
